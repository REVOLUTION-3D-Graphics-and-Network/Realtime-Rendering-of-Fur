# Real-Time Rendering and Simulation of Fur
Project in the course TSBK03 - Advanced Game Programming at Linköping University. 

Real-time rendering and simulation of fur is an interesting topic. To get at good-looking and realistic result a lot of data is needed. Simulating hair is however quite easy to do on the GPU, it is easy to do in parallel where each thread can handle one hair strand. This project was done by one student for the course Advanced Game Programming at Linköping University. The project uses the method proposed by Han and Harada in 2012 to simulate the hair strands of the fur. This method is stable enough for real-time purposes and preserves the initial style of the fur. The method worked very well and the result looks pretty good.
